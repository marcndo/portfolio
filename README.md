# Machine Learning / AI Portfolio - MARCEL AMBO NDOWAH.

Welcome to my Machine Learning and AI portfolio! This repository showcases various projects I have worked on, ranging from predictive models to deep learning systems.

## Skills:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Docker, Git
- Other: Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Model Deployment (Flask, Streamlit)

## Featured Projects:
### [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens Dataset](https://github.com/marcndo/movie-recommendation)

Developed a personalized movie recommendation system leveraging the Surprise library to analyze and predict user preferences based on the popular MovieLens dataset. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to provide accurate, data-driven movie recommendations tailored to individual tastes, enhancing user experience and engagement.

### [Project 2: AI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot with LLMs](https://github.com/marcndo/customer-service-chatbot)

Developed a customer service chatbot leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT and techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Question Answering (QA). The bot scrapes Stack Overflow for relevant data, uses NLP to understand and process queries, and delivers precise, context-driven responses, improving support efficiency and user satisfaction.
