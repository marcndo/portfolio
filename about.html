      <h1>About Marcel Ambo Ndowah</h1>

      <section id="intro">
        <p>
          I am <strong>Marcel Ambo Ndowah</strong>, a passionate <strong>Machine Learning & AI Engineer</strong> with a strong foundation in <strong>Mathematics</strong>. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, where I specialized in various advanced topics such as
          Abstract and Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Complex Analysis, Group Theory, Set Theory, Topology, Differential Equations, and Affine Geometry.
        </p>

        <h2>Background & Journey into ML/AI</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into programming and technology began with my love for problem-solving. While studying mathematics, I enrolled in elective courses from the Computer Science department, including <em>Data Structures and Algorithms in C programming</em>, <em>Algorithm Analysis and Design</em>, and courses in <em>Python and C programming</em>. These electives opened my eyes to the world of software development, and I quickly became passionate about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation, I started self-learning from a variety of online resources, including <strong>W3Schools</strong>, <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong>, <strong>Python-Engineer</strong>, and <strong>Kaggle</strong>. I later enrolled in the <strong>100 Days of Code</strong> challenge on <strong>Udemy</strong> to deepen my programming skills. This learning journey led me to the <strong>AWS Scholarship Program</strong>, which introduced me to <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>. It was here that I found my true calling, and my passion for these fields grew rapidly.

        <h2>Professional Experience & Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I began my professional career as a <strong>Support Engineer</strong> for a <strong>SolarWinds project</strong>. This was my first exposure to the tech industry, and I gained valuable experience in problem-solving and client communication while working as a subcontractor for <em>1 year and 2 months</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my passion for <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>AI</strong> grew, I decided to pivot my career toward these fields. I resigned from my role to pursue further education, earning <strong>IBM Professional Certificates in Machine Learning and Generative AI</strong> through <strong>Coursera</strong>. Additionally, I completed the <strong>Kaggle/Google 5-Day GenAI Intensive Training Program</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also had the privilege of contributing to an <strong>open-source project</strong> as part of the <strong>Outreachy program</strong>, working with the <strong>OCaml API Diff</strong> algorithm. During my time on this project, I significantly improved the API by adding detection for class additions and deletions, implementing <em>CRAM</em>, and developing <em>unit tests</em> for end-to-end testing. My contributions were merged into the project and are currently in production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities in <strong>Machine Learning and AI Engineering</strong>. I am also exploring the development of <strong>Google Agent Development Kits (ADK)</strong> and working with <strong>JAX</strong> for potential open-source contributions. I regularly read research articles from <strong>arXiv</strong> to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in AI and continue experimenting with ML algorithms to deepen my understanding.

      <section id="leadership">
        <h2>Leadership & Mentorship</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical expertise, I have developed strong leadership and mentorship skills. I served as the <strong>President of the Mathematics Student Association</strong> at my university, where I organized tutorials for junior students, helping them navigate challenging courses in mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneously, I was the <strong>Academic Officer for the Faculty of Science Students Association</strong>, where I worked to bridge the gap between the administration and students, ensuring that academic concerns were addressed efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these roles, I learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and mentoring the next generation of passionate students in STEM fields. These experiences have helped me grow both as a leader and as a team player.
